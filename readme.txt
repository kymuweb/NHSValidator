The calculation

Multiply each of the first nine digits by a defined weight. The weight is shown below:

1 - 10
2 - 9
3 - 8
4 - 7
5 - 6
6 - 5
7 - 4
8 - 3
9 - 2

For example if the 2nd digit is 3 then its 3 x 9. If fourth digit is 7 then its 7 x 7

Get the sum of the 9 multiplications.

Divide this sum by 11 and get the remainder

Subtract 11 from the remainder to get the total

If the total is 11 then the identifier is 0, otherwise the identifier is the total

If the identifier is 10 then the NHS Number is wrong

If the identifier equals the check number then the NHS number is correct
